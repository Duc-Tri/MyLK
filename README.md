You must have the CHROME BROWSER to test this extension.

Download and decompress the project somewhere. Lets say for instance D:\mylk

1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three dots, and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

3. Click "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" to pop up a file-selection dialog.

4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it. For this project, it ll be D:\mylk\chrome-extension

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.
