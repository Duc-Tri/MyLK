# MyLK
My Lifelong Learning Managment is an European research project, see http://mylk-project.info/

You must have the CHROME BROWSER to test this extension.

Download and decompress the project somewhere. Lets say for instance D:\mylk

1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox), and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

3. Click "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" to pop up a file-selection dialog.

4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it. For this project, it ll be D:\mylk\chrome-extension

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.

5. Click on the icon of Mylk which just appeared at the right of address bar. Click on "ON"

6. The extension will start to collect data from your current tab, ONLY for wikipedia, dailymotion and youtube urls. The data is sent every 6 seconds.

7. To see the results, open another browser (it can be another Chrome, but pay attention to the ACTIVE tab, which only will be processed by the extension) and go to : https://mylk.formavisa.com/. This url will refresh every 5 seconds.

You can put both browsers side-by-side to see the changes in real time.

8. Click on  the icon of Mylk then select "OFF" or uninstall the extension to stop sending data to the server.
